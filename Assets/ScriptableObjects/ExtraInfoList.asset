    infoDescription:
    - '<line-height=90%>Other groups aside from the Foundation exist behind the veil.
      The Sarkic cults consist of divided fleshcrafter communities who revere disease
      and eschew morality in favour of acting on base desires.


      This group
      is typically Hostile to the Foundation and most of humanity.'

    infoTitle: Groups of Interest Relations
    infoDescription:
    - '<line-height=90%>Whilst most groups may dislike the Foundation''s mission,
      many of them are happy to team up with the Foundation in the name of ''The
      enemy of my enemy is my friend''.


      This is exemplified by the Sarkics
      and Mekanites who have been at each others throats for hundreds of thousands
      of years and will do anything to destroy the other.'
